Sentiment-Analysis
Analyzed sentiment on reviews of businesses that sell pizza in Chicago, IL. Creaated chart and word cloud from the acquired data.

Instructions:
In a Jupyter Notebook, perform sentiment analysis on reviews using an API such as Yelp Fusion.

Your analysis should include the following:

Introduction (in Markdown): an overall question that you have about your dataset, along with your name and date and description of the problem and summary of your solution.
Use the API to search for at least 60 reviews about your topic. (Note Yelp Fusion only delivers 3 reviews per business.)
Clean your reviews as needed.
Perform sentiment analysis on these reviews, displaying a donut chart of the positive, negative, and neutral percentages. Use the default Textblob analyzer and then compare it with the results of the NaiveBayesAnalyzer.
Delete the stop words from the reviews using the NLTK library stop-words lists.
Display a WordCloud of the top 20 words used in the reviews you cleaned.
Conclusion (in Markdown): include insights that you learned from this analysis.
